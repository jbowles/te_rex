# T-rex
The Bayes classifier is written to solve some small domain sepcific problems. This means it is not a classififer to be used for general problems.


## Bayes
This Bayes classifier was written specifically to classify `cancellation policies` and `error messages` from Hotel reservation providers. This doesn't mean it can't be used for other things, but it **does mean it should be used a general solution for anything.**

The the small domain focus of this classifier can most be gleaned from the `BayesData` class. It cleans the text in way specific to the goals I had in mind.
